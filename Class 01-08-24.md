The `<div>` element is a container that is used to group other HTML elements together.  
It does not have any specific visual effect on its own, but it allows you to apply styles or manipulate its contents using CSS or JavaScript.

**Example**:
```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
<div>
    This is a div element.
</div>
<!-- Output: This is a div element. -->
